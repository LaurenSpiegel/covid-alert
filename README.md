## Getting `app` to work

The dashboard and package directories mostly speak for themselves. To get the app to run, run the following lines:

1. `yarn install` to install dependencies
2. `react-native link` to add assets (fonts and images) to packages
3. If you want to install ios, run `cd ios && pod install && cd ../`
4. To run android locally
   ```
   export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
   export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
   export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
   export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
   export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
   yes | sdkmanager --licenses
   ```
5. `yarn start` for hot reloading
6. iOS: `yarn ios` / Android: `yarn android`
